Manual Testing of Registration, Login, Logout, Forgot Password in OpenCart – 
Performed manual testing on key user authentication features of the OpenCart platform, including Registration, Login, Logout, and Forgot Password pages. The goal was to ensure seamless functionality, security, and user experience across these features.
•	Registration Testing: Validated user registration functionality by testing form submission, input validation, and confirmation email delivery. Ensured proper error handling for invalid inputs.
•	Login Testing: Conducted tests on login functionality with correct and incorrect credentials, verified session management, and confirmed proper redirection post-login.
•	Logout Testing: Ensured users could successfully log out, and validated session termination and access restrictions after logout.
•	Forgot Password Testing: Tested password recovery flow, ensuring email functionality and reset link worked correctly. Verified users could reset passwords and successfully log in with new credentials.
Key focus areas included usability, security (data protection), cross-browser compatibility, and error handling. Identified and documented issues for resolution, improving the platform's user authentication flow and overall reliability.
